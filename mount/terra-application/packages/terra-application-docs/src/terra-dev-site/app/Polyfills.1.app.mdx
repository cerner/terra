# Polyfills

The [terra-application](/application/terra-application/application) package requires polyfills to function in some of its supported browsers. We recommend using the [terra-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cerner/terra-polyfill) package to ensure the minimum requirements are met for a project.

## Usage

```jsx
import '@cerner/terra-polyfill';
```

<Notice variant="caution" ariaLevel="3">
  The polyfill should be imported only once for an application. Duplication may lead to increased bundle sizes and decreased performance of an application.
</Notice>

<Notice ariaLevel="3">
  The polyfill should be imported as early as possible in an application's lifecycle to ensure that the polyfilled features are available when they are needed.
</Notice>

## Included Polyfills

* [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) - Includes polyfills for ECMAScript up to 2021: promises, symbols, collections, iterators, typed arrays, many other features
  * Only stable features are included by default. Any ES features under proposal will require additional polyfills if they are used.
* [`regenerator-runtime`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regenerator-runtime) - Standalone runtime for Regenerator-compiled generator and async functions

### Filtering `core-js` with Babel

The set of polyfills included by core-js an be customized by modifying the `@babel/preset-env` configuration. See [core-js documentation](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#babelpreset-env) for more details.

For example:

```diff
module.exports = (api) => {
  api.cache(false);
  api.assertVersion('^7.4.4');

  return {
    presets: [
-     '@babel/preset-env',
+     ['@babel/preset-env', { useBuiltIns: 'entry', corejs: { version: 3.14 } }], // version should match core-js dependency version
      '@babel/preset-react',
    ],
  };
};
```

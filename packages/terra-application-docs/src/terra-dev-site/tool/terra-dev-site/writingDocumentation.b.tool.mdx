# Writing Documentation

Writing component documentation with `terra-dev-site` is easy. We support github style markdown and mdx. Simply add a `.doc.mdx` file to `terra-dev-site` and it will be converted into react for you.

## Loaders

Terra Dev Site offer several webpack loaders to help write easier documentation. The loaders are all accessed through the use of webpacks [resource query](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#ruleresourcequery).

For example to use the example loader you would require your example with the `?dev-site-example` resource query.

```jsx
import Example from './example?dev-site-example';
```

* [Codeblock Loader](/dev_tools/cerner-terra-application-docs/terra-dev-site/webpack-loaders/codeblock-loader): Import a component into a syntax highlighted codeblock.
* [Example Loader](/dev_tools/cerner-terra-application-docs/terra-dev-site/webpack-loaders/example-loader): Render and example and display the code in a hidden section below it.
* [Package Loader](/dev_tools/cerner-terra-application-docs/terra-dev-site/webpack-loaders/package-loader): Convert package.json information into badges.
* [Props Table Loader](/dev_tools/cerner-terra-application-docs/terra-dev-site/webpack-loaders/props-table-loader): Create a props table for react components.

## Terra Documentation Components

Terra offers several light weight react components to help enrich your documentation from the terra-docs package.

[terra-docs documentation](/dev_tools/cerner/documentation-components/button).

## MDX

Terra dev site uses MDX as a markdown loader. MDX allows you to mix JSX syntax into your markdown documents. This is very helpful for pulling in examples and richer content for documentation.

To use mdx syntax you must use a .mdx file extension.

For example the following block will render into:

```md
import { Notice } from '@cerner/terra-docs';

# Hello, *terra*!

Below is an example of JSX embedded in Markdown.

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

If you leave spaces between your component and it's content, the content will be parsed by **mdx**.

</Notice>
```

With the output below:

---

# Hello, *terra*!

Below is an example of JSX embedded in Markdown.

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

If you leave spaces between your component and it's content, the content will be parsed by **mdx**.

</Notice>

---

### MDX loader

Mdx is loaded at build time rather than interpreted at run time. The mdx loader that is used is more strict that the 'marked' library previously used.

The MDX loader requires closing tags. For example the before markdown would fail because the img tag was not closed.

```diff
- <img height="128" width="128" src="https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site/raw/main/terra.png" alt="terra logo" >
+ <img height="128" width="128" src="https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site/raw/main/terra.png" alt="terra logo" />
```

MDX also has a bug where a comment cannot directly follow a closing tag.

```diff
-<h1>
-hi mom
-</h1>
-<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

+<h1>
+hi mom
+</h1>

+<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```
